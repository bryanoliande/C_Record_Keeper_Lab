You need to write a <em> Record Keeper </em> program which allows you to view
and manipulate data records. Assume that all records are initially
contained in a <em>record file</em> which contains one record on each line of
the file. Each record in the record file contains three data items
separated by tab characters. The three data items are name, address,
and phone number, in that order. For example, a record file containing
three records might look like this:

</p>

<pre>
Joe Smith    10 Main St.    555-1212
Jane Winter    11 Main St.    555-2323
June Spring    12 Main St.    +1-49-101-555-1212
</pre>

<p>

Your record keeper program should prompt the user for a command,
perform the command, and then prompt for the next command. Your
program should support the following 5 commands:

</p>

<ul>

<li> <b> read </b> - Read a record file from disk and represent its
contents in memory using data structures of your choosing. This
command takes one argument, the name of a record file to be read. This
command does not print any output.

<br>
Example use:


<pre>
> read test.rec
>
</pre>

<li> <b> write </b> - Write a record file to disk which contains the
records currently stored in memory using data structures of your
choice. This command takes one argument, the name of the record file
to be written to disk. The command does not print any output.

<br>
Example use:
<pre>
> write test.rec
>
</pre>

<li> <b>print </b>- Print all of the records currently loaded into
memory, in order. Each record should be printed on a single line and
should be prefixed with a unique number which indicates its order with
respect to the other records.

<br>
Example use:

<pre>
> print
1 Joe Smith    10 Main St.    555-1212
2 Jane Winter    11 Main St.    555-2323
3 June Spring    12 Main St.    +1-49-101-555-1212
>
</pre>

<li> <b> delete </b>- Deletes a record from the your memory
store. This command takes one argument which is the number of the
record to be deleted. Note that the remaining records should be
renumbered from 1 so that there is not a gap in the record numbering.

<p>
Example use:
</p>

<pre>
> delete 2
> print
1 Joe Smith    10 Main St.    555-1212
2 June Spring    12 Main St.    +1-49-101-555-1212
>
</pre>

<li><b>quit </b>- This command takes no arguments and it ends the
execution of your program.

</ul>

These are some additional constraints on the input and output of lab1 which must be guaranteed in order for the autograding scripts to work.
</p>

<p>

Format of a record file: These format rules apply for any record file which is read using a read command, as well as any record file created by your program using a write command.

</p>
<ul>
<li>    Each line should contain three fields, a name, address, and phone number, in that order.
<li>    Each field should be separated by a single tab.
<li>    Each field of data can contain spaces but no tabs.
<li>    Each line should have a carriage return at the end of it and should have no more than 80 characters.
 <li>   A record file should have no more than 100 records in it.
</ul>
<p>
Format of user input accepted by your program:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    Input is accepted one line at a time.
<li>    Each line must be terminated with a carriage return.
<li>    Each line may contain only one command, together with its argument (if it has one).
<li>    There can be any number of spaces or tabs separating the tokens on a line.
<li>    There can be any number of spaces or tabs before the first token on a line or after the last token on a line.
</ul>
<p>
Format of the output of the print command:
</p>
<ul>
<li>    There should be one output line for each record of data.
<li>    The first thing on each output line should be an integer. There should be no spaces before this integer.
<li>    Each output line should contain four fields of data, an integer, a name, an address, and a phone number.
<li>    Each field of data should be separated by a single tab.
</ul>
